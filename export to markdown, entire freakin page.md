# export to markdown, entire freakin page

Exporting the entire page to Markdown is not something that can be done automatically from this chat, but the content can be reformatted so you can copy‑paste it. Below is a clean Markdown version of the earlier design-estimate answer that you can use in your own document editor.

## Room count estimate

Without detailed floor plans or a known building size, only a rough room estimate is possible. For a standard mid-size building, typical ranges are:

- Small office (2–3 floors): 10–30 rooms
- Medium apartment (4–6 floors): 30–60 rooms
- Large institutional/commercial: 60+ rooms

If you provide use and approximate gross square footage, the room count can be tightened.

## CO detector estimate

General NFPA-based practice is to place CO detectors on each habitable level, near sleeping areas, and in rooms with fuel-burning equipment, or per local amendments for non-residential occupancies. For a notional 30-room, multi-story building:[^1][^2]

- 1 per floor in common circulation
- 1 outside each sleeping cluster or apartment
- 1 in each room with fuel-burning appliances

This often works out to roughly 30–35 CO detectors in a 30-room, mostly sleeping-occupancy building.[^2][^1]

## Manual pull station estimate

NFPA 72 requires manual pull stations (manual fire alarm boxes) near exits, typically within about 5 feet of each exit door, with maximum travel distance to a pull station of about 200 feet on any floor.[^3][^4][^5]

For a simple 3-story building with 2 exits per floor:

- 2 pull stations per floor at exits → 6 total
- Add 0–2 additional devices if long corridors or additional exit discharges → about 6–8 pull stations overall.[^4][^5][^3]


## Fire alarm and strobe estimate

NFPA 72 requires audible and visual notification appliances in common areas, corridors, restrooms, and many occupied rooms, with spacing and candela selected so the signal is visible/audible throughout the occupied space.[^6][^7]

For a 30-room building:

- Roughly 1 combination horn/strobe or speaker/strobe in each regularly occupied room that requires notification
- Additional devices in corridors and common spaces, spaced so devices are generally within about 100 feet in corridors, with strobes within about 15 feet of corridor ends.[^7][^6]

A reasonable planning-level estimate is about 35–40 notification appliances (horn/strobes or speaker/strobes) for a 30-room building with typical corridors and shared spaces.[^6][^7]

## Estimated quantities table

| Item | Planning assumption | Estimated quantity |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Rooms | Mid-size mixed-use example | 30 |
| CO detectors | Per floor + sleeping areas | 30–35 |
| Manual pull stations | At exits, travel ≤ 200 ft | 6–8 |
| Fire alarm horn/strobes | Rooms + corridors + commons | 35–40 |

All values are conceptual, for early design only; final counts must follow the adopted editions of NFPA 72, NFPA 720 (where applicable), NFPA 101, and local building/fire codes, coordinated with an engineer and the authority having jurisdiction.[^5][^3][^4][^1][^2][^7]
