# Tower Building Fire Safety System Assessment

I notice that you've requested an assessment of a tower building's fire safety systems, but no actual blueprint was provided in your query. I'll explain how these elements would typically be determined in a tower building based on industry standards and code requirements.

## Number of Rooms per Floor

Room quantity in tower buildings varies based on the building's design and purpose. Typically, rooms are numbered following these conventions:

- Buildings with 1-9 stories use three-digit room numbers (first digit is floor number, next two digits are room identifier)[^1]
- Buildings with 10-99 stories use four-digit room numbers (first two digits indicate floor)[^1]
- Buildings with 100+ stories use five-digit room numbers[^1]

Room numbering typically follows patterns such as:

- Sequential numbering (odd numbers on one side of corridor, even on the other)[^5][^12]
- Racetrack numbering (clockwise progression from main entrance)[^5]
- Zone-based numbering for areas with large collections of cubicles[^5]

Without the actual blueprint, I cannot provide a specific count of rooms per floor.

## Fire Safety Equipment Requirements

### Smoke Alarms and CO Sensors

Smoke detector placement follows specific code requirements:

- Inside each sleeping room/bedroom[^13][^17]
- Outside each separate sleeping area in the immediate vicinity of bedrooms[^13][^17]
- Within 21 feet of all bedroom doors[^13]
- On every level of the dwelling unit[^13][^17]
- Not within 36 inches of HVAC supply registers[^20]
- Not within 3 feet of ceiling fans, air ducts, exterior doors, or windows[^13]

CO detectors would typically be required where fuel-burning appliances exist or in sleeping areas near such appliances.

### Manual Pull Stations

Pull stations are typically required:

- At exits/egress points on each floor[^2][^7]
- Near stairwells
- In corridors at required intervals (often 200-300 feet apart)
- At the designated locations on fire alarm system drawings[^2][^8]


### Strobes

Visual notification devices (strobes) placement is governed by:

- Wall-mounted devices at 80-96 inches above the finished floor[^11]
- Coverage area specifications that account for viewing angles[^11]
- Requirement to be visible from all areas requiring notification[^11]
- Mounting height considerations affecting required candela rating[^11]
- Minimum 15dB above ambient sound level for audible notification[^11]


## Conclusion

Without examining the actual blueprint for the tower building, I cannot provide specific counts for rooms, smoke alarms, pull stations, or strobes. These items must be carefully calculated based on the building's specific layout, occupancy type, and applicable building codes (such as NFPA 72, IBC, and local amendments).

For a proper fire safety system estimation, I would need to review the blueprint details including floor layouts, room dimensions, egress paths, and intended use of spaces. This would allow for accurate quantity determinations following the appropriate code requirements.
